1. Regression Projects
In this section, we explore projects focused on predicting continuous values using regression techniques. These projects cover various applications like sales forecasting, housing price prediction, and insurance risk assessment. Each project demonstrates the implementation of different regression algorithms, including linear regression, ridge regression, Lasso, and advanced techniques like Gradient Boosting and Random Forests. Evaluation metrics such as Mean Absolute Error (MAE), Mean Squared Error (MSE), and R-squared are used to assess model performance and optimize predictions.

2. Classification Projects
Here, we focus on projects aimed at predicting categorical outcomes. This section includes applications like customer churn prediction, fraud detection, and error type classification. Various classification algorithms, such as Logistic Regression, Decision Trees, Support Vector Machines (SVM), and Neural Networks, are employed. We provide a detailed explanation of performance metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, and ROC-AUC to ensure comprehensive model assessment.

3. Time Series Projects
This section includes projects focused on analyzing and forecasting time-dependent data, such as stock prices, demand forecasting, and seasonal sales analysis. Techniques include traditional ARIMA models, Seasonal Decomposition of Time Series (STL), and modern approaches like Prophet and Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks. Key aspects like trend, seasonality, and autocorrelation are emphasized to enhance the forecasting quality, with performance measured using metrics like Mean Absolute Percentage Error (MAPE) and Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE).
